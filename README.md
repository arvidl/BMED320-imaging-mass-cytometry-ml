**INTRODUCTION**

Imaging mass cytometry or CyTOF ([Fluidigm](https://www.fluidigm.com) is a clever and powerful tool for leveraging mass spectroscopy to acquire imaging data from tissues with 40+ labels at the same time. The general premise of the technology is as follows:

- Traditional tissue slices on microscope slides are labeled with antibodies to highlight specific proteins of interest but instead of the antibodies being conjugated to fluorophores like they are in fluorescence microscopy, they are conjugated to metals that normally would not appear in vivo (e.g. palladium).
- After the tissues are labeled with these metal-conjugated antibodies, the slides are ablated with a laser in approximately
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1 \mu m^2"> pixels. The tissue from these pixels and associated metals are then passed through a mass spec which can quantitatively assess the presence and quantity of each metal in a pixel. After a pixel is ablated, another adjacent pixel is ablated within a 1000 x 1000 pixel field of view until all of the metals from each pixel have been passed through the mass spec.
- Using the mass spec data associated with each pixel, an image can then be created for each marker from the tissue.


**ADVANTAGES OF IMAGING MASS CYTOMETRY**

The core advantage of imaging mass cytometry compared to fluorescent microscopy is that there is almost no noise in the data as each metal isotopes has its on distinct detection peak and does not overlap with other metal isotopes. Furthermore, because metal isotopes are used that do not typically occur in vivo, there is almost zero background noise and thus the contrast between markers of interest and the background is ideal for image analysis. Because of this lack of noise, a single tissue sample can be imaged for 40+ markers simultaneously from a single slide. This broad multiplex capability means that complex research questions can be addressed and researchers for example can study many immune cell types and subtypes combined with key spatial and cell markers.

**DISADVANTAGES OF IMAGING MASS CYTOMETRY**

When imaging tissues, there is no one size-fits-all solution and the same holds true for Imaging Mass Cytometry. There are several disadvantages with the approach that researchers need to be aware of when considering adopting the technique:

- Imaging Resolution and Field of View: When using this approach, we are generating 1,000,000 different mass spec samples and then using these mass spec samples to generate imaging data. Therefore, the time required for mass spec analysis limits the number of pixels that we can sample in a reasonable time wherein we can sample 1,000,000 pixels in approximately 2 hours. This means that it takes 2 hours to sample a 1 mm2 area from a slide and thus we can only sample 0.2% of the area of a cover slip every two hours. Additionally, this pixel size and field of view is only equivalent to roughly 10X magnification imaging which means that we are slightly limited in the cellular features we can observe.
- Data Generation and Time: The time required to sample a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1 \mu m^2"> area of tissue means that we can only sample 12 slides or samples per day. This is comparable to 4 channel fluorescent slide scanning but in that case we are able to scan whole slides and to image at 40X. Therefore, fluorescent slide scanning generates 1,000 times more data in the same period of time of.
- Cost: Imaging mass cytometry requires the use of metal-conjugated antibodies which can be substantially more expensive than fluorescent conjugated antibodies which greatly increases the consumable cost of imaging. Additionally, imaging mass cytometry requires the use of argon as well as helium gas for mass spec analysis which are expensive consumables.

**Use Cases for Imaging Mass Cytometry**

The key use case for imaging mass cytometry is for research questions that involve more than ten markers but where high resolution and large spatial areas are not required. This technology is particularly applicable in the fields of immuno-oncology and immunology where researchers are interested in study the complex interplay between many different types of immune cells (e.g. T-Cells, B-Cells, natural killer cells, macrophages) and immune cell subtypes.

## Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) at UiB

cf. [Flow Cytometry Core Facility](https://www.uib.no/en/clin2/flow) at UiB

**Flow cytometry** is a technology that measures and analyzes the optical properties of mono-dispersed single particles, such as cells, bacteria, picoplankton, microbeads, yeast, platelets, nuclei and other similarly-sized particles, passing single file through a focused laser beam.

An important feature of flow cytometry is that large numbers, for example thousands of particles per second, are analyzed and therefore provide a statistically significant picture of a specimen's physical and biochemical make-up.

At the core facility you also have access to the **Mass cytometer** the the Helios Imaging Mass Cytometer (Fluidigm) at nominal resolution
of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1 \mu m^2">. This technology allows for the analysis of more than 42 parameters simultaneously on a single cell basis, to enable breakthrough discovery and comprehensive functional profiling applications.


## Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) at UiB

cf. [Hyperion - Image Mass Cytometry](https://www.uib.no/en/clin2/flow/120463/hyperion-image-mass-cytometry) at UiB

The [Hyperion^TM Imaging System](https://www.fluidigm.com/products/hyperion-imaging-system) is a high-parameter imaging system capable of analyzing 4 to 37 protein markers at subcellular resolution in fixed tissue sections, Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, or cell smears. With the ability to utilize up to 135 channels to detect additional parameters, the Hyperion Imaging System is ideal to meet researcher needs today and well into the future.

The Hyperion Imaging System is based on the HeliosTM mass cytometry platform. This high-dimensional imaging platform uses mass-tagged antibodies to markers alongside cell structural features in tissue and cell smears.

Mass-tagging involves separation of signals based on the differences in mass, resulting in distinct signals for each marker without the need for compensation associated with fluorometric techniques yet far more specific and sensitive than tag-free techniques.

The metal tags can be defined within 1 Da spatial resolution in tissue and cell smears, resulting in a unique spatial and parametric definition of the cells in situ. The system enables understanding of protein behavior and interactions to drive biological breakthroughs.



# Workflow of imaging mass cytometry ([Bodenmiller lab](http://www.bodenmillerlab.com/research-2/imaging-mass-cytometry))
Imaging mass cytometry couples immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods with high-resolution [laser ablation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_ablation) to CyTOF (cytometry by time of flight) mass cytometry. Currently, the method allows the simultaneous imaging of 44 proteins and protein modifications at subcellular resolution; with the availability of additional isotopes, measurement of over 100 markers will be possible.

![Bodenmiller lab](http://www.bodenmillerlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/NMETH-A19779B_GiesenEtAl_CyTOF_Imaging_Figure1.jpg)
Workflow of imaging mass cytometry (Figure from Giesen et al., Nature Methods, 2014 Apr;11(4):417-22). Tissue sections are prepared for metal-chelated antibody labeling using IHC protocols. Then, tissue samples are positioned in a laser ablation chamber. The tissue is ablated and transported by a gas stream into the CyTOF for mass cytometry analysis. The **measured isotope signals are plotted using the coordinates of each single laser shot** (enabling spatial maps = imaging), and a multidimensional tissue image is generated. Single-cell features and marker expression are determined, allowing the investigation of cell subpopulation properties within the analyzed tissue.

### Summary of Image Processing and Analysis Techniques in MCI (=IMC)
(from Baharlou et al. Front. Immunol., 14 November 2019 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02657)

(**A**) Following the acquisition of MCI, image processing is performed to denoise the images, perform single-cell segmentation to identify cell outlines, and to classify these cells based on marker expression. (**B**) One way of exploring cell composition between groups is to compare the change in the cell fractions. (**C**) Another way to explore cell composition is to classify patients as being positive and negative for a particular cell population. The co-occurrence of cells can be presented similar to what is presented here, and significance of co-occurrence can be identified using a chi-square test. (**D**) Differences in marker expression between patients can be visualized using a heatmap. (**E**) Cell morphology measurements can be used to explore cell phenotypes. (**F**) Cell-cell interactions can be measured using neighborhood analysis or point-process analysis. With a neighborhood analysis, percentage of significant images (i) or Z-scores (ii) of the cell-cell interactions can be represented as a heatmap, with significant associations associated with a more positive Z-score and significant avoidance is associated with a more negative Z-score. With a point-process analysis, an L function can be used to assess the significance of cell-cell interactions. The L function being above or below the gray envelope generated by bootstrapping corresponds to association and avoidance, respectively (iii). (**G**) One way of measuring cell or marker association with a marker is to classify cells as being near or far away from the border. A cell composition analysis can be used to explore differences, or differences in marker expression can be explored, as shown here.

## Other advanced microscopic imaging options at UiB


#### New instrument for 3D EM and correlative microscopy arrived at Elmilab (Oct 6th, 2020)
A new **[Zeiss Gemini 450](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/int/products/scanning-electron-microscopes/geminisem.html)** field-emission scanning electron microscope is currently being installed at [Elmilab](https://www.uib.no/en/elmi) at the MatNat faculty. The main applications are high-throughput imaging of tissue sections (3D EM) and correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM).

The design of the electron column, the detectors and the implemented tools for automation allow for imaging of large areas and large series of sections at high speeds. The images look like images obtained in standard transmission electron microscopy and have a **resolution down to 1nm**.

The sections can be mounted on grids as they are used in standard transmission electron microscopy or on conductive substrates like silicon wafers or coated glass slides. This eases sample preparation, and it makes the instrument an excellent tool for correlative light and electron microscopic studies, where you image a sample first with LM and than with EM.

Possible applications range from **3D-analysis of cells**, tissues, and organs to clinical diagnostics and pathology, the **reconstruction of neural circuits and connectomics**, and the visualization of standard light microscopic markers on the EM level. This way, data on protein or gene function can be put into the context of cellular ultrastructure in molecular biological and medical sciences.

The instrument shall be available for UiB users from early next year. From then, we aim to provide dedicated user training, assistance in project planning, and on request, full service of EM sample preparation, imaging, and relevant image processing. We will keep you updated.

You are welcome to contact us in advance if you consider including EM work in your next grant application.
